### Procedure

#### a) Circuit formulation:

1. Connect the appropriate component to its position by connecting wires.<br>
2. Repeat the above process for all the components.

#### b) Operating the circuit: 

1) Set the values of DC input voltage (V<sub>in</sub>) and modulation index (M)<br>
2) Press “RECORD” button to simulate the circuit and observe various waveforms.<br>
3) Change “V<sub>in</sub> and M” to observe the waveforms at different operating conditions. <br>
4) Press “Download” button to download the files.
