### Procedure

a) Circuit formulation:
<br>

1. Connect the appropriate component to its position by connecting wires.<br>
2. Repeat the above process for all the components.

b) Operating the circuit: 
<br>

1) Set the values of DC input voltage (V<sub>in</sub>) and modulation index (M)<br>
2) Press “RECORD” button to simulate the circuit and observe various waveforms.<br>
3) Change “V<sub>in</sub> and M” to observe the waveforms at different operating conditions. <br>
